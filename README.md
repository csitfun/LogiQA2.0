## About
This is the version 2 of the LogiQA dataset, first released as a multi-choice reading comprehension dataset by our previous paper [LogiQA: A Challenge  Dataset for Machine Reading Comprehension with Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08124). The dataset is collected from the Chinese you can download the version 1 of the LogiQA dataset from [here](https://github.com/lgw863/logiqa-dataset)
