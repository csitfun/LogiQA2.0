{"id": 1486, "answer": 2, "text": "Scientists have found that the immune regulation of mesenchymal stem cells has such a plasticity, that is, it is like a moderator of the inflammatory environment: when the inflammatory response increases, mesenchymal stem cells inhibit the immune response; when the inflammatory response weakens, mesenchymal stem cells may promote the immune response. This characteristic needs to be paid great attention in the process of treating diseases. For example, scientists have found that mesenchymal stem cells entering the human body can significantly alleviate the condition of patients with liver cirrhosis, reduce the inflammatory reaction in the liver, and improve liver function indexes such as bilirubin and albumin. However, dexamethasone can counteract the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells on liver cirrhosis to a considerable extent. The reason is that when patients receive the combined treatment of dexamethasone and mesenchymal stem cells, the inflammation in the focus of patients with liver cirrhosis will be reduced, resulting in the weakening of the immunosuppressive effect of mesenchymal stem cells and the complete disappearance of the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells. it may even aggravate the disease.", "question": "According to this text, which of the following statements is correct?", "options": ["The therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells on liver cirrhosis is better than that of dexamethasone.", "Mesenchymal stem cells can counteract the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on inflammation.", "The combined use of mesenchymal stem cells and some drugs may undermine their therapeutic effect on inflammatory diseases.", "Scientists can shape the immunomodulatory function of mesenchymal stem cells according to the characteristics of inflammatory environment."], "type": {"Sufficient Conditional Reasoning": true, "Conjunctive Reasoning": true}}

Taking a cue from nature, NASA scientists are working on wings that can bend and deform. The idea is that at high speeds, the plane's deformed wings are tucked back slightly to reduce drag and turbulence. As the plane slows down, the wings automatically extend forward to help it land faster and more smoothly. But deforming a wing is no easy task. The key is to create a deformable wing using special smart materials that flex and stretch automatically when exposed to external air pressure and stimulation. Among them, the wing material made of memory alloy can make the airplane wing change into a special shape in a certain air environment; Another important smart material is piezoelectric ceramics, which can respond sensitively to changes in voltage, temperature and other environmental factors. Scientists say such planes with flexible wings are at least 20 years away.
